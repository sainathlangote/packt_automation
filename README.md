# Hybrid Selenium Framework - README
This is Basically hybrid driven framework, i have used in project so as part of this i have created page objects, Number of Utility classes 
and some configuration files and all these concepts comes under reusable componentslike page objects, configuration files and by using the these
reusable componants i have created number of test cases and these testcases i have executed through TestNG framework, i have created multiple 
topics like parallel testing, parameterization and data provider annotation to automate data driven testcases and i have executed all my testcases 
if test suite by using testing xml 
And I have designed a extent report to generate the report we have used an API called as Extent Report.

## 4a. Reasoning for the Choice of Hybrid Framework

In this project, we have implemented a hybrid framework for Selenium test automation using Java. Here's why we chose this approach:

### Hybrid Framework
- A hybrid framework combines the best features of various automation frameworks, such as Data-Driven and Keyword-Driven,
 providing flexibility and reusability.
- It allows us to separate test data, test scripts, and keywords, making maintenance and scalability easier.
- Java is a popular language for Selenium automation, offering a wide range of libraries and tools for efficient testing.

## 4b. Installation Instructions

To set up and run this Selenium Java hybrid framework, please follow these installation instructions:

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) - Install the latest version (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- Eclipse IDE (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- Selenium WebDriver - Download Selenium WebDriver JAR files (https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)
- TestNG - Install TestNG from the Eclipse Marketplace or download it (https://testng.org/doc/download.html)

### Steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git

### Steps
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project.git
Import the project into Eclipse as a Java project.

Add the Selenium WebDriver JAR files to the project's build path.

Install the TestNG plugin for Eclipse (if not already installed).

4c. Instructions to Run Your Test Cases
To execute the test cases using the hybrid framework, follow these steps:

Open Eclipse and import the project.

Navigate to the "testcases" package within the project, and open a test case file (e.g., LoginTest.java).

Right-click on the test case file and select "Run As" > "TestNG Test."

TestNG will execute the test case, and the results will be displayed in the Eclipse console.

4d. Additional Information-

Customize your test data by editing Excel or CSV files in the "testdata" directory.
Modify keywords and test steps in the "keywords" package to create new test cases.
The project structure may include directories for test data, keywords, and test cases, ensuring better organization and maintenance.
If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the project's issue tracker or contact the project maintainers.
Feel free to provide more information, such as a description of the project's directory structure, how to handle different browsers, or any additional dependencies. The more comprehensive your documentation, the easier it will be for users to understand and utilize your Selenium Java hybrid framework.
